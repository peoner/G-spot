# Description: ,,,
#   This is a sample jtag ID table. This file can be used to define ,,,
#   additional devices to be detected by the hw_server application. ,,,
#,,,
#   In this file empty lines lines with spaces and lines that begin ,,,
#   with the '#' character will be ignored.,,,
#,,,
#   The format of this file is as follows:,,,
#,,,
#     ROW 1: fields ,,,
#            The standard JTAG id fields are idcode,mask,irlen,name
#     ROW 2: field types,,,
#            For each field specified in ROW 1 the type is used to ,,,
#            interpret the field data read per device. The types ,,,
#            accepted are I for integer and s for string. If,,,
#            you use the standard fields on ROW 1 then you should,,,
#            use i i i s in ROW 2 to set the fields idcode mask,,,
#            irlength to integer and name as string,,,
#,,,
#   To use this table you start hw_server with the following ,,,
#   command line arguments:,,,
#,,,
#    hw_server -e set device-info-file <file>,,,
#,,,
#   Where <file> is replaced with this filename.,,,
# Make sure 0x is infront of the idcode and mask value indicating HEX,,,
# NO spaces between the commas,,,
